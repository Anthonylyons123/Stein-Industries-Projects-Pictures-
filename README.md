**Capacitor Bank** – Designed and modeled in SolidWorks to meet system performance and integration requirements.

**Custom Water Tank Test Unit** – Designed and fabricated to evaluate the cooling capabilities of the sourced coolant system. I collected and analyzed performance data from this unit, which I then used to guide the design of a new cooling system. The final design ensured equal or improved performance compared to the original sourced system.
